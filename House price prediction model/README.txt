===OUTLINE FOR MODEL===
=======================

===Purpose of the model===
The main goal for this model is to help give a general idea of price movements with in average house
prices over time. The particular area used for the model was London

===Data===
For this project I downloaded the property price data for all of the regions of England to plot the initial 
average price graph. However, for the main part of the notebook and training the model only the London 
data is needed for recreation of the model.
